# NASA Internship Web Scraper
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SORT NASA INTERNSHIPS  >:(

The internship site seems to be dynamically loaded, so still figuring out how to load data directly. Dynamic js loading with requests isn't working ahhhhhhh

However, this will do the sorting at least. You can sort by keywords or insert your own sort functions easily.
